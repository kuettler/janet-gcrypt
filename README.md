# gcrypt

FFI use of the gcrypt library.

This is the result of an experiment, kept here as a found memory. Janet's ffi
is awesome and allows the use of dynamic libraries with ease. In this case the
GNU gcrypt library can be used to calculated hashes withou much ado. The
actual functions here are merely examples.
